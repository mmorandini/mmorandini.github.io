<h4 class="pa0 ma0">THE PROJECT</h4>
<p>
	FeelGood is an app I developed with three other GA colleagues as our group project for the course.<br> The app aims to help charities raising funds in a particular way.<br> Let's be honest, getting involved with charities can result in too much of a commitment sometimes; and also some other times charities are not organized very efficiently in terms of releasing informations to the public. We therefore are in this weird scenario where people struggle to find a place to volunteer and charities struggle to raise enough money or labour for their purposes.
</p>
<p>
	The way we decided to tackle this mismatch was to create a network where people in need of any 
	sort of help would post tasks and a reward they're willing to pay for it to be done (just like TaskRabbit...).
</p>
<p>
	On the other side users willing to do something good for the community can apply for one of the tasks that other have posted, choose the charity they want to help and through our app donate the money they've earned by completing the task.
</p>
<p>
	Weâ€™ve used JustGiving as an external API for the charity search. I personally dealt with authentication and front-end development, as well as setting up the environment for the back-end.
