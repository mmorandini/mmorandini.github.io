I’ve always been involved in creative processes, from making my own toys as a child to being the one dealing with graphics and design for projects and essays as a young man; along with an innate love for music (yes, I do dj sometimes..).
The affinity with tech and computers led me to the WDI course at GA, which helped me to piece things together. I’m now looking for a junior level position in an environment that could satisfy my hunger for learning and help me develop my career.
