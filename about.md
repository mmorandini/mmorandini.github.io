I’ve always been involved in the creative process, from making my own toys as a child to being the one dealing with graphics and design for projects and essays as a young man; along with an innate love for music (yes, I do dj sometimes..).

I think there's a moment in your life when you have to start following your aspirations, and so I decided to quit my previous job to take the Web Development course at General Assembly which turned out to be an amazing learning experience and it also put me in the right position to finally start a ; and even though the more I code the more I realise how much I don't know, I feel I'm doing what I want to do, and that's what should matter, really.

I’m now looking for a junior level position in an environment that could satisfy my hunger for learning and help me develop my career.
